# Antimetal MCP Setup

You are helping the user connect their AI editor to the Antimetal MCP server at `https://mcp.antimetal.com`.

## Primary path — OAuth (recommended)

Most modern AI editors handle OAuth automatically when you connect to a remote MCP server. No manual configuration is needed:

1. The editor opens a browser window with Antimetal's login page
2. The user logs in (SSO or email/password)
3. The editor receives a token and stores it securely
4. Done — `/investigate` and `/fix` are ready to use

**If your editor opened a browser login and it succeeded, you're done.** Run `search_issues` to verify connectivity.

## Fallback path — API key

If OAuth isn't working or your editor doesn't support it, use an API key:

1. **Generate a key** — go to `https://overlook.antimetal.com/settings/api-keys` and create a new API key
2. **Set the environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export ANTIMETAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
   Add it to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) to persist across sessions.
3. **Configure your editor** (if the env var isn't picked up automatically):

   **Claude Code** — add to `.mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "antimetal": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://mcp.antimetal.com",
         "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${ANTIMETAL_API_KEY}" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Cursor** — add to `mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "antimetal": {
         "url": "https://mcp.antimetal.com",
         "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${ANTIMETAL_API_KEY}" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **VS Code** — add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "antimetal": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://mcp.antimetal.com",
         "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${ANTIMETAL_API_KEY}" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart your editor** after changing the config.

## Verify the connection

Call `search_issues` with no arguments. A successful response (even an empty list) confirms the MCP server is connected and authenticated. An `Unauthorized` error means the token/key isn't being sent correctly.
